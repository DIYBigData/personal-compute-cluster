# Deploy Stand Alone Spark Cluster on Docker Swarm

This project brings up a simple Apache Spark stand alone cluster in a Docker swarm. It will also launch and make available a Jupyter PySpark notebook that is connected to the Spark cluster. The cluster has [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org) and [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org) preinstalled for your PySpark on Jupyter joys.

## Usage
First, edit the following items as needed for your swarm:

1. `configured-sparknode -> spark-conf -> spark-env.sh`: adjust the environment variables as appropriate for your cluster's nodes, most notably `SPARK_WORKER_MEMORY` and `SPARK_WORKER_CORES`. Leave 1-2 cores and at least 10% of RAM for other processes.
2. `configured-sparknode -> spark-conf -> spark-env.sh`: Adjust the memory and core settings for the executors and driver. Each executor should have about 5 cores (if possible), and should be a whole divisor into `SPARK_WORKER_CORES`. Spark will launch as many executors as `SPARK_WORKER_CORES` divided by `spark.executor.cores`. Reserve about 7-8% of `SPARK_WORKER_MEMORY` for overhead when setting `spark.executor.memory`.
3. `build-images.sh`: Adjust the IP address for your local Docker registry that all nodes in your cluster can access. You can use a domain name if all nodes in your swarm can resolve it. This is needed as it allows all nodes in the swarm to pull the locally built Docker images.
4. `deploy-spark-swarm.yml`: Adjust all image names for the updated local Docker registry address you used in the prior step. Also, adjust the resource limits for each of the services. Setting a `cpus` limit here that is smaller than the number of cores on your node has the effect of giving your process a fraction of each core's capacity. You might consider doing this if your swarm hosts other services or does not handle long term 100% CPU load well (e.g., overheats). Also adjust the `replicas` count for the `spark-worker` service to be equal to the number of nodes in your swarm (or less). 

This set up depends on have a GlusterFS volume mounted at `/mnt/gfs` on all nodes and the following directories exist on it:

* `/mnt/gfs/jupyter-notbooks` - used to persist the Jupyter notebooks.
* `/mnt/gfs/data` - This is where data to analyze with spark gets placed.

You could replace the GlusterFS mount with some other network mount, such as NFS.

Then, to start up the Spark cluster in your Docker swarm, `cd` into this project's directory and:
```
./build-images.sh
docker stack deploy -c deploy-spark-swarm.yml spark
```

Point your development computer's browser at `http://swarm-public-ip:7777/` to load the Jupyter notebook.
